# dataStructures
Work from my data structures and algorithms course at Georgia Tech.

Assignments are primarily focused on creating data structures in Java from scratch rather than using built in methods.

HW1: code to create ArrayList
HW2: code to create LinkedList
HW3: code to create Deque
HW4: code to create BST
HW5: code to create minHeap
HW6: code to create hashmap
HW7: code to create AVL tree
HW8: code to create 5 sorts (cocktail sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and LSD radix sort)
HW9: code to create 3 pattern matching algorithms (Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), Boyer-Moore, and Rabin-Karp)
HW10: code to create 4 different graph algorithms
